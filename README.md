# BombBot
CPSC 599.81 Project

BombBot is a collaborative game where pairs of players exchange information about bombs in order to defuse them. Each player is assigned a role of either the Expert or the BombBot, whom are the remote expert and local user respectively as per the literature. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible against endless waves of bombs with only seven lives. The game is divided into rounds of increasing difficulty, but players can take a break in between each round.

In BombBot mode, players must search for bombs that spawn in a circular plane around them. Using the gyroscope, players rotate on the spot to look around the virtual reality world for bombs. There are also four directional pillars to assist the BombBot with maintaining their orientation. When a bomb has been found, its shape and color must be told to the Expert to get the correct diffusion solution. Once a bomb has been defused, the BombBot then searches for the next bomb to defuse.

In Expert mode, players have an overview of the entire circular plane and an indicator of all the current bombs with their remaining timers. They also have an indicator for the current direction BombBot is facing. To help defuse the bombs, they have a decoding panel with two input panels for the colour and shape of the current bomb. Once they get this information from the BombBot, they can hit the input buttons and get an output solution which the BombBot can use to successfully defuse the bomb. If a bombâ€™s timer runs out or if an incorrect solution is used, the bomb will explode causing the team to lose a life.
